Argentina'
s relations with the bloc countries-
BRAZIL
A cohort of 15 young women from Brazil and another 30 from Argentina recently completed a sport programme sponsored by UN Women and the International Olympic Committee (IOC). Under the “OWLA Participate” initiative, they expanded their communications and advocacy skills, and met with several high-profile decision-makers in the sport ecosystem to raise key challenges and propose strategies to expand girls’ and women’s access to sport.
The initiative builds upon the strong legacy of the One Win Leads to Another (OWLA) programme, which enhanced leadership skills of 2,000 girls and young women in Brazil and 1,200 in Argentina through sport.

In the political sphere, proximity with Argentina is an important pillar in the effort to construct a space of peace and cooperation around Brazil. The high density of political cooperation between the two countries is reflected in regular bilateral meetings and visits at presidential and ministerial levels. In recent years, several institutional dialogue channels have been strengthened, in particular those concerning the holding of Bilateral Production and Trade Commission meetings; the reactivation of the Nuclear Policy Permanent Committee; the creation of the Political Coordination Mechanism at the level of deputy foreign ministers; and the resumption of a forum for coordination between ministers of Foreign Affairs and Defense, arranged in the format of a Political-Military Dialogue.

INDONESIA
Bilateral relations have continued to improve with various new collaborations formed over the last 5 years, namely: MoU on agricultural cooperation (since May 2017); Joint Statement on the Establishment of a Working Group for Trade and Investment (since June 2019); MoU on cooperation in Education (since June 2019); MoU on cooperation in the field of guaranteeing halal products (since October 2021), and MoU on Political Consultation (Octobre 2022). Political relations and inter-parliamentary cooperation were also carried out. The Indonesian House of Representatives (DPR) has also formed the indonesia-Argentina Bilateral Cooperation Working Group (GKSB) as a form of increasing cooperation between the two countries. The GKSB was last recorded as having made a working visit to Argentina in July 2022.

    MODERATED CAUCUS- GENDER PAY GAP
Honorable chair and esteemed delegates 
As rightly said by Emma Watson: "If we do nothing, the pay gap will still exist in 2080. It’s a clear call to action."
Argentina believes that gender equality at workplace is the foundation of a just society. Despite the significant steps made by governments, the harsh truth is that this issue is still prevalent in most countries.
Argentina has enacted laws to protect women's rights in the workplace, such as ensuring equal pay for equal work and equal representations in the national legislative positions
Argentina believes that compulsory pay transparency to be there across all sectors of the economy. This will help countries to identify and expose pay disparities and women will be able to negotiate on their salaries. Argentina recommends the implementation of gender quotas in leadership positions in all sectors of the economy. Ensuring that women have a say in the decision-making, diversity is fostered.
Workplace policies that support work-life balance, such as flexible working hours and accessible childcare facilities should be created. These policies should be universally available, ensuring that women can thrive in their careers.
Argentina calls upon all delegates to commit to these measures and work collaboratively to eliminate gender-based disparities in workplace.
Thank you







        MODERATED CAUCUS 3
Honorable Chair, esteemed delegates,
Discrimination and violence are among the most pervasive and destructive challenges our world faces today. They are barriers to achieving true equality and hinder the progress of our societies. As the delegate of Argentina, I stand before you today to emphasize the urgent need to address and eliminate these issues in all their forms.
In Argentina, we have seen the devastating impact that discrimination and violence can have on individuals and communities, particularly on women, minorities, and vulnerable groups. We believe that ending these injustices requires not just laws, but a fundamental shift in our cultural and social norms.
To achieve this, we must focus on three key areas:
1.	Education and Awareness: We need comprehensive education programs that promote tolerance, respect, and human rights. These programs should start at a young age and be integrated into our schools, workplaces, and communities. By educating our citizens, we can challenge stereotypes, reduce prejudice, and foster a culture of inclusion.
2.	Strengthening Legal Frameworks: It is crucial to have strong legal protections against discrimination and violence. Argentina supports the implementation and enforcement of laws that protect individuals from all forms of violence and discrimination. We must ensure that these laws are not only in place but are effectively enforced, with mechanisms for reporting and addressing violations.
3.	Empowering Victims: We must provide support and resources for those who have been affected by discrimination and violence. This includes accessible legal aid, counseling services, and safe spaces for victims to seek help. Empowering victims to speak out and seek justice is key to breaking the cycle of violence.
Ending discrimination and violence is not just a moral imperative; it is essential for the development and prosperity of our societies. We must work together, as a global community, to create a world where every individual is treated with dignity, respect, and equality.
Thank you.
